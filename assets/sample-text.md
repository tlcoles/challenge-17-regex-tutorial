# A quick guide to understanding regex
For this week's challenge of the ESMT Coding Boot Camp, I explain regular expressions, commonly known as regex. I will draw from diverse online resources, which I will link to for your further research, and I will detail the parts of a regex using a specific example.

## History
Before we dive into what regex can do, a brief word to its origins. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), the American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleen formalized the concept of a regular expression in 1951 with his definition of mathematical notation called "regular events." In the late 1960s, the use of regex in computer science and programming grew. Today, among many [situations where regex can save the day](http://www.rexegg.com/regex-uses.html), regex is widely used in programming languages and libraries, including Javascript, on which this tutorial is focused.

## Definitions

A regular expression, or regex, is a pattern comprised of a sequence of characters and used for searching text. The aforementioned characters are either **literal characters** or **metacharacters**. 

Let's use the word "apple" as an example. 

A search for a literal character `a` would show one match with the "a" in **a**pple. A search for a `p` would show two matches in a**pp**le.  

Metacharacters, on the other hand, have special meanings. For example, in the sentence 

**I like to eat Gala apples.**

the word **apples** could be described and found with `\w\w\w\w\w\w`. The metacharacter `\w` stands for an alphanumeric character, meaning letters A to Z (whether lowercase or uppercase) and digits 0 to 9. The word **apples** is six characters long. Be careful to recognize, however, that `\w\w\w\w\w\w` stands for any six-characters in a row. You can see how that would work on the preceding text in the image below.

There are many metacharacters (see the [JavaScript RegExp Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp) on W3Schools). We will examine them in additional detail in the exercise below.

## Tutorial

For this tutorial, we will search for a domain (e.g., GitHub.com, Amazon.com, ) in a body of lorem ipsum text refashioned in Markdown, a markup language for plain-text editors. (This tutorial was written using Markdown.) The sample text was generated by Fillerama, a lorem ipsum generator that uses content from the animated series Futurama. Click here for [a screenshot of the sample text on Fillerama.com](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21356324/193410615-3fec9ae7-fec6-4cec-948c-8f8bd1fdd8e6.png). The text has letters, numbers, and special characters and, of course, so does the URL. We thus want to find the unique combination of characters written as a regex to describe a URL.

In the Markdown version created for this tutorial, I added a line that stated `"For more Futurama-derived lorem ipsum, visit [Fillerama.io](http://fillerama.io/)."` 

To find a URL in a body of text with regex, I use the following:  

`/(?:http(s)?:\/\/)?[\w.-]+(?:\.[\w\.-]+)/g`

The regex above matches both `Fillerama.io`and `http://fillerama.io/`as seen in this <a id="our-example">screenshot</a> of the test using [regexr.com](https://regexr.com/6v846).

For this tutorial, I rely heavily on Regexr as well as resources W3Schools, MDN, and Rexegg. Please see the [acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) below for all resources used in this tutorial. 



## Regex components
A regex comprises of anchors, boundaries, quantifiers (greedy and lazy), conditionals, character classes, character escapes, flags/modifiers, capturing and non-capturing groups, bracket expressions, backreferences, and lookarounds. In this tutorial, I will only address those used in the regex of a URL. However, I encourage you to read about them all at RexEgg, a comprehensive resource on regular expressions. (See the [acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) section for links to RexEgg and more.)

### Grouping and Capturing
Because our regex begins with grouping – specifically `(?:http(s)?:\/\/)` – let's begin our detailed breakdown by explaining what grouping does.

Parentheses (also known as round brackets) work in regular expressions much like they do in mathematical equations. That is, `()` are used to group together expressions so that its group value can be evaluated and used. In the example regex

`/(?:http(s)?:\/\/)?[\w.-]+(?:\.[\w\.-]+)/g`

we have `(?:http(s)?:\/\/)` and `(?:\.[\w\.-]+)`.

In the first grouping, the [literal characters](#definitions) `h`, `tt`, `p`, `s`, `:`, and `//` really only matter as a group, either as `http://` or `https://`. If you were to search for the literal characters, you would find many, many instances – 177 matches, in fact, according to [regexer](https://regexr.com/6v89n).

As you can see in the screenshot of [our example](#our-example), however, the regex finds two matches. One of them, `Fillerama.io`, includes neither `http://` nor `https://`. Which brings us to...

### Quantifiers
In our regex, `(?:http(s)?:\/\/)?`, you can see a single `?` within and directly behind the grouping. This is unlike the `?:` at the start of the parentheses, which designates the group as a [non-capturing group](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-disambiguation.html#noncap). Rather, the single `?` is an example of a quantifier, one of four  – `*`, `+`, `?`, and `{x,y}` – that modify the [literal character or the metacharacters](#definitions) directly to their left. 

The site RegEgg has a great example of these:

* in `A+` the **once or more** quantifier `+` applies to the character `A`
* in `\w*` the **zero times or more** quantifier `*` applies to the metacharacter `\w`
* in `carrots?` the **zero times or once** quantifier `?` applies to the character `s` *not* to `carrots`
* in `(?:apple,|carrot,){1,9}` the **x times at least, y times at most** quantifier `{x,z}`applies to the entire subexpression `(?:apple,|carrot,)`.

Click here to read more about [Mastering Quantifiers](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quantifiers.html) on rexegg.com.

In our example, the `(s)?` says that the match includes an `http` that may or may not have an `s`. Similarly, the `(?:http(s)?:\/\/)?` says that the match may have an instance of `https://` or `http://` or – as in the case of the match [`Fillerama.io`] – neither.
